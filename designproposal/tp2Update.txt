Updates for TP2: 

1. Not sure if audio feature can be implemented. It'll be after 
I do TP2, so if I can figure it out before TP3 then I will have the 
feature. (Fast Fourier Transformations part)

2. I fixed the algorithm issue for ghost tracking with A* so now the
ghost can't go diagonally, which is more realistic game play. 

3. Small visual changed compared to storyboard - once you find key, 
a door is drawn rather than the grid becoming yellow

Also, welcome slide does not have a key on it. 

Fog of war is not circular. 

Once game ends (win or die), the total score isn't broken down into 
pieces, rather it's just displayed as the whole score. The score also 
is made out of 4 main parts: 

1. Winning - 1000
2. Finding Key - 100
3. Finding Clue - 100 per clue
4. Surviving - .5 per timerFired

Also I'm considering adding a vent feature to be able to go from one grid
location to another one by venting, which will make the game play more 
interesting and engaging. Also, the journal seems to be not as interesting, so
I am thinking of adding a feature where if you record all the clues in the 
journal then you can unlock a ghost killer item.
