Updates:

The major updates are:

I added in Among Us style vents, along with a database to keep track of high 
scorers. You can either play free style, where you score won't be saved, or sign
in and play, where your score will be saved. 

I also cleaned up some graphics and minor bugs, but these changes were minor.
