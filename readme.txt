Hi and Welcome to Phasmophobia112, Avantika Naik (avantikn)'s CMU 15-112
term project. Here's everything you need to know to play! 

How to Play:
You're stuck in a maze and it's dark and you're trying to find your way out. As
you traverse through the maze, you can come across different item:
1. Clues - the possible clues you can find are: 
    "handprint", "ectoplasm", "freezing temps", "blood splatter", writing", "water"
    Mark them in your journal (pressing j) to get points for finding them. Beware
    of taking too long! 
2. Bonus - There are three bonuses:
    "crucifix", "snack", "battery", each which give you a different bonuses of 
    extra life, speed, and bigger light range respectively. 
3. Vents - there are two vents which connect to each other. They're like among us
    vents. Stand on one and press v to vent to the other one
4. Key - This is your golden ticket out (quite literally, it's gold). Before you
    can make it to the door at the bottom right corner, you need to get the key
    first. Only then will the door appear.

Sounds easy, right? BUT as you're going through the maze, there's a really smart
ghosty boy trying to chase you. Luckily, you can squeeze past him if you can time
it just right and get the angle right, but your best best is to be smart about 
to traverse through the maze. 

Keys: 
WASD or Arrow keys to move, j for toggling journal screen (can't toggle if you're 
typing in the journal text box), v to vent (when you're on a vent), h for help. 

Good luck! 

How to Run:
Make sure you have the term_project.py file and the Phasmo112Scores.db in the 
same directory. Once you have that, all you need to do is ctrl-b and run the 
python file: term_project.py

Libraries:
None that need to be installed! I'm using sqlite3 but that comes with Python 
thankfully. But the database Phasmo112Scores.db needs to be there! 

You also need to have cmu-112 graphics in the same directory as the code! 

Shortcut Commands:
TA hax!
While on the maze screen (these won't work on the title, mode, or journal screen) 
1. Pressing f will toggle the fog so it's much easier to see 
2. Pressing k will teleport you to the key - one time use per round
3. Pressing l will teleport you to the door - one time use per round
3. Pressing h will toggle if you can see the help screen or not
4. Pressing r will reset the game

NOTES:
The journal mechanisms are apparently a little untuitive accorsing to the people 
who tested my game (aka my family). The way all the journal/text boxes work is 
by clicking on the box (which is the tan rectangle journal screen or in the  
colored section on the sign-in page). Then it'll change color, meaning you selected
it. You can begin to type right away, and the filler text will disappear. Once you 
are done typing, press enter or escape ONLY to stop typing in that box. The text box
should change back to the right color. Then you can click on another text box to
start typing on that one. Just remember to hit escape or enter to exit out of a text box.

And on the title screen, you will be automatically sent to the game once you finish
typing your username and password.
